# neutronpy

It is my personal fork of the original neutronpy project.
I have included resolution calcualtion options from Tobi Weber, and heavily reworked the resolution convolution functions.


I hate the installation method. The dependencies have incompatible versions, especially because of numpy and matplotlib.

Also the package is bit inflated for future developments. I have removed everything I don't use at the moment.
